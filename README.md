# kubernetes
These files are for use in my live class Kubernetes in 4 Hours.
This class is on learning.oreilly.com, contact mail@sandervanvugt.nl for more details

Setup instructions:
1.  Install the latest version of Fedora Workstation
2.  Enable virtualization extensions in BIOS or Virtualization software. (VMware preferred - Oracle VirtualBox only supports embedded virtualization on AMD CPU's - consider using a 60 day free evaluation of VMware Workstation)
3.  Run kube-setup.sh as root and follow prompts

For everything else: attend my class at learning.oreilly.com
